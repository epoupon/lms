# LMS - Lightweight Music Server

[![Last Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/epoupon/lms?logo=github&label=latest)](https://github.com/epoupon/lms/releases) [![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/epoupon/lms/Build?logo=github)](https://github.com/epoupon/lms/actions) [![Language grade: C/C++](https://img.shields.io/lgtm/grade/cpp/g/epoupon/lms.svg?logo=lgtm&logoWidth=18)](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/epoupon/lms/context:cpp)

_LMS_ is a self-hosted music streaming software: access your music collection from anywhere using a web interface!

A [demo instance](http://lms-demo.poupon.dev) is available. Note the administration panel is not available.

## Main features
* Low memory requirements: the demo instance runs on a _Raspberry Pi Zero W_
* Recommendation engine
* Audio transcode for maximum interoperability and low bandwith requirements
* Multi-value tags: artists, genres, composers, lyricists, moods, ...
* [MusicBrainz Identifier](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Identifier) support to handle duplicated artist and release names
* [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org) support for scrobbling and synchronizing listens
* Compilation support
* Disc subtitles support
* ReplayGain support
* Persistent play queue across sessions
* _Systemd_ integration
* User management, with several authentication backends, see [Deployment](INSTALL.md#deployment)
* Subsonic API, with the following additional features:
  * Playlists
  * Bookmarks

## Music discovery
_LMS_ provides several ways to help you find the music you like:
* Tag-based filters (ex: _Rock_, _Metal_ and _Aggressive_, _Electronic_ and _Relaxed_, ...)
* Recommendations for similar artists and albums
* Radio mode, based on what is in the current playqueue
* Searches in album, artist and track names (including sort names)
* Starred Albums/Artists/Tracks
* Various tags to help you filter your music: _mood_, _albummood_, _albumgenre_, _albumgrouping_, ...
* Random/Starred/Most played/Recently played/Recently added for Artist/Albums/Tracks, allowing you to search for things like:
  * Recently added _Electronic_ artists
  * Random _Metal_ and _Aggressive_ albums
  * Most played _Relaxed_ tracks
  * Starred _Jazz_ albums
  * ...

The recommendation engine uses two different sources:
1. Tags that are present in the audio files
2. Acoustic similarities of the audio files, using a trained [Self-Organizing Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map)

__Notes on the self-organizing map__:
* training the map requires significant computation time on large collections (ex: half an hour for 40k tracks using a Core i5)
* audio acoustic data is pulled from [AcousticBrainz](https://acousticbrainz.org/). Therefore your audio files _must_ contain the [recording](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Recording) [MusicBrainz Identifier](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Identifier).
* to enable the audio similarity source, you have to enable it first in the administration panel.

## Subsonic API
The API version implemented is 1.16.0 and has been tested on _Android_ using _Subsonic Player_, _Ultrasonic_ and _DSub_.

Since _LMS_ uses metadata tags to organize music, a compatibility mode is used to navigate through the collection when using the directory browsing commands.

The Subsonic API is enabled by default.

__Note__: since _LMS_ may store hashed and salted passwords or may forward authentication requests to external services, it cannot handle the __token authentication__ method. You may need to check your client to make sure to use the __password__ authentication method.

## About tags
_LMS_ relies exclusively on tags to organize your music collection.

### Filtering
You can specify the tags you want to be used to filter your collection. By default, `GENRE`, `ALBUMGROUPING`, `MOOD` and `ALBUMMOOD` tags are used.
In the administration  panel, you can set whatever tags you want, even custom tags.

### Multiple album artists
_LMS_ requires the `ALBUMARTISTS` and `ALBUMARTISTSSORT` tags to properly handle multiple album artists on the same album. As they are a custom tags, you may need to setup your favorite tagger to add them.

__Note__: if you use [Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/), add the following script to include these tags:
```
$setmulti(albumartists,%_albumartists%)
$setmulti(albumartistssort,%_albumartists_sort%)
```

## Keyboard shortcuts
* Play/pause: <kbd>Space</bbd>
* Previous track: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Left</kbd>
* Next track: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Right</kbd>

## Security considerations
_Wt_ (the web framework used) has some [built-in security measures](https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/features#security), but _LMS_ also has some too:
* to mitigate brute force login attempts, _LMS_ uses an internal login throttler based on the client IP address. The `Client-IP` or `X-Forwarded-For` headers are used to determined the real IP adress, so make sure to properly configure your reverse proxy to filter or even erase the values (see example in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)).
* all passwords are stored hashed and salted using [bcrypt](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)
* all the resources relative to the music collection (tracks, covers, etc.) are private to a session

## Installation
