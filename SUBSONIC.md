# Subsonic API
The API version implemented is 1.16.0 and has been tested on _Android_ using _Subsonic Player_, _Ultrasonic_, _Symfonium_, and _DSub_.
Since _LMS_ uses metadata tags to organize music, a compatibility mode is used to browse the collection when using the directory browsing commands.
The Subsonic API is enabled by default.

__Note__: since _LMS_ may store hashed and salted passwords or may forward authentication requests to external services, it cannot handle the __token authentication__ method. You may need to check your client to make sure to use the __password__ authentication method.

# OpenSubsonic API
OpenSubsonic is an initiative to patch and extend the legacy Subsonic API. You'll find more details in the [official documentation](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app/)
