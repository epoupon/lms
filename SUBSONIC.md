# Subsonic API
The API version implemented is 1.16.0 and has been tested on _Android_ using _DSub_, _Subsonic Player_, _Symfonium_, _Tempo_ and  _Ultrasonic_.

Folder navigation commands are supported. However, since _LMS_ does not store information for each folder, it is not possible to star/unstar folders considered as artists.
Given the API limitations of folder navigation commands, it is recommended to place all tracks of an album in the same folder and not to mix multiple albums in the same folder.

The Subsonic API is enabled by default.

# OpenSubsonic API
OpenSubsonic is an initiative to patch and extend the legacy Subsonic API. You'll find more details in the [official documentation](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app/)

## Authentication
_LMS_ supports the [API Key Authentication](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app/docs/extensions/apikeyauth/) method. Each user has to generate their own API key on the settings page to use the Subsonic API.

By default, API keys can also be used as passwords, provided the `user` parameter matches the API key owner. To disable this fallback authentication method, set the following in `lms.conf`:
```
api-subsonic-support-user-password-auth = false;
```

__Note__: the token+salt authentication method is not supported.
